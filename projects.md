### Supporting Listening to Diverse Opinions in Online Space by Reducing Stereotypes
###### CSCW 2021 Full Paper

A lot of people believed that the Internet could be an ideal public sphere, where everyone can freely exchange their opinions. However, in reality, people tend to only listen to opinions aligned with their own by filtering out perspectives challenging their prior viewpoints. Sometimes, people even end up having stereotypes on people with opposing opinions, like “it would be just moms with teenager kids who think that video game addiction should be regulated”.

What if people can discover there exists a variety of opinions from diverse groups of people? What if we can see a person with a completely different stance on a social issue from us but with a lot of shared characteristics? Will we pay more attention to their opinions? Based on this idea, we recently launched an experimental online platform called “별별생각” (byulbyul.kr), where a) people can share their characteristics as well as their opinions on social issues and b) people can see the distribution of opinions and search for people with shared characteristics.

###### CHI 2019 Extended Abstracts

Personal deliberation, the process through which people can form an informed opinion on social issues,serves an important role in helping citizens construct a rational argument in the public deliberation.However, existing information channels for public policies deliver only few stakeholders’ voices, thusfailing to provide a diverse knowledge base for personal deliberation. This paper presents an initialdesign of PolicyScape, an online system that supports personal deliberation on public policies byhelping citizens explore diverse stakeholders and their perspectives on the policy’s effect. Building onliterature on crowdsourced policymaking and policy stakeholders, we present several design choicesfor crowdsourcing stakeholder perspectives. We introduce perspective-taking as an approach forpersonal deliberation by helping users consider stakeholder perspectives on policy issues. Our initialresults suggest that PolicyScape could collect diverse sets of perspectives from the stakeholders ofpublic policies, and help participants discover unexpected viewpoints of various stakeholder groups.
