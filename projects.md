### Supporting Listening to Diverse Opinions in Online Space by Reducing Stereotypes

###### CSCW 2021 Full paper

Enabling the free and equal exchange of arguments on social issues in a respectful manner is an integral part of establishing the democratic ideal. However, the current manifestation of online spaces tends to facilitate the gathering of like-minded people, leading to the polarization of opinions. Such polarization inhibits the sharing of diverse opinions and deteriorates respect for disagreeing opinions. To tackle this issue, we present StarryThoughts, an online system that supports users to express and explore diverse perspectives on social issues. The system supports three types of exploration of the collected arguments online: navigating opinions based on the demographic identities of the posters, checking the the stereotypes users hold towards demographics in relation to given social issues, and engaging with opinions with semantically different point-of-views. By deploying the system to the public in co-operation with a nationwide broadcasting company, we collected 1,950 opinions with 144 free-form responses from 1,209 visitors as initial data and iterated on the design. Results from a user study with 56 participants showed that the system enables participants to explore a wide range of opinions on social issues, be more informed on the various arguments, and be more confident about their opinions. From our findings, we provide several design considerations for building online systems for supporting users to explore diverse opinions on social issues.

###### CHI 2019 Extended Abstracts

Personal deliberation, the process through which people can form an informed opinion on social issues,serves an important role in helping citizens construct a rational argument in the public deliberation.However, existing information channels for public policies deliver only few stakeholders’ voices, thusfailing to provide a diverse knowledge base for personal deliberation. This paper presents an initialdesign of PolicyScape, an online system that supports personal deliberation on public policies byhelping citizens explore diverse stakeholders and their perspectives on the policy’s effect. Building onliterature on crowdsourced policymaking and policy stakeholders, we present several design choicesfor crowdsourcing stakeholder perspectives. We introduce perspective-taking as an approach forpersonal deliberation by helping users consider stakeholder perspectives on policy issues. Our initialresults suggest that PolicyScape could collect diverse sets of perspectives from the stakeholders ofpublic policies, and help participants discover unexpected viewpoints of various stakeholder groups.
